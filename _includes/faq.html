	<h2>What is the #10DayWebBuild Challenge?</h2>
	<p>During the #10DayWebBuild, you’ll build a new website over a period of 10 days while posting about it on social media every day. There are no limits to what you can build, it can be as simple or complex as you desire. Any language, any framework, it’s all up to you.</p>

	<h2>What are the requirements?</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>The final version of the website must be hosted and have a live URL. Free hosting can be found in the links on the Resources page.
            </li>
        <li>The website must be responsive and mobile-friendly using techniques such as media queries.
            </li>
        <li>You must tweet every day for 10 days about your project.</li>
        <li>On the final day (day 10), you’ll post the link to the live URL along with a screenshot or picture of your final project.
            </li>
        <li>No broken links. You can ensure all of your links work with the Dead Link Checker.
            </li>
        <li>Accessibility best practices is not a requirement, but is highly recommended. You can read more about accessibility at (LINK), and check for accessibility concerns using the WAVE tool.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Am I required to post my progress every day on social media?</h2>
    <p>Yes! #10DayWebBuild was created in order to help push new users to become active on social media. While there are other popular challenges such as #100daysofcode, it can be challenging to come up with new social media posts every day. #10DayWebBuild has one focus: posting about the website you are creating for the next 10 days.</p>
    <h3>Things you can post about:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Plans and ideas</li>
        <li>The design process</li>
        <li>New Features</li>
        <li>Bug fixes</li>
        <li>Setbacks and challenges</li>
        <li>Anything related to your website</li>
        <li>Questions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to participate?</h2>
    <p>The challenge starts at any time you decide. This will allow you to pick the best time in your schedule that will allow you to focus on building your website over a period of 10 days.</p>
    <p>You will need a social media account if you don’t already have one. #10DayWebBuild originally started on Twitter (check out the original post that started it all), but you can use any social media platform you want.</p>
    <p>For the next 10 days, you’ll work on building your website and post about it every day on social media. How much you work on it each day is up to you. If you have a busy day and can only work on it for a few minutes, that’s fine! Just make sure to tweet about it. Don’t worry about missing a day or two either. The goal is to build it over 10 days, whether that’s 10 consecutive days or 10 days total. We encourage you to try and devote 10 consecutive days to the challenge if possible, but life happens and we understand. As long as you work on your website for a total of 10 days, and make 10 social media posts, you can consider the challenge completed!</p>
    <p>On your final day (day 10), you’ll be required to post a link to a live version of your website along with a picture or screenshot of the website you built. This will help show off all of your hard work on social media and help raise awareness about your efforts as a developer. Don’t know where to host your website? You can find a list of free resources here, including a list of website hosts you can use to host your new website.</p>
